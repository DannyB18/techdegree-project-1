        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web developer who is finally making the career change I've always dreamt of. I've
          really
          enjoyed my career in construction, but my heart has always belonged to computers and technology. So I'm
          hoping
          to take my love for building and combine it with my love for computers to create all sorts of things.
          Whether
          it be websites or apps, I'm looking forward to building everything I can imagine.</p>
        <p>I've lived in Florida my whole life, in many different areas from south to central Florida. I've had a wide
          variety of jobs which have allowed me to gain all types of skills and have also given me many different
          perspectives on life. I am excited to see where my new endeavors will lead me.</p>

      <section id="Goals" class="card">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to able to create fantastic websites for all purposes. I would also love to be able to create
          software
          and hopefully learn to use technologies such as:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>C#</li>
          <li>.NET</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'd like to make my career change official by working for a tech company as a developer, and helping to
          create many new projects.</p>
